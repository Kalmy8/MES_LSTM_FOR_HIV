	To develop multivariate vector-ARMA (VARMA) forecast models for predicting emergency department (ED) demand in Western Australia (WA) and compare them to the benchmark univariate autoregressive moving average (ARMA) and Winters’ models.
	Methods
	Seven-year monthly WA state-wide public hospital ED presentation data from 2006/07 to 2012/13 were modelled. Graphical and VARMA modelling methods were used for descriptive analysis and model fitting. The VARMA models were compared to the benchmark univariate ARMA and Winters’ models to determine their accuracy to predict ED demand. The best models were evaluated by using error correction methods for accuracy.
	Results
	Descriptive analysis of all the dependent variables showed an increasing pattern of ED use with seasonal trends over time. The VARMA models provided a more precise and accurate forecast with smaller confidence intervals and better measures of accuracy in predicting ED demand in WA than the ARMA and Winters’ method.
	Conclusion
	VARMA models are a reliable forecasting method to predict ED demand for strategic planning and resource allocation. While the ARMA models are a closely competing alternative, they under-estimated future ED demand.}, journal={Journal of Biomedical Informatics}, author={Aboagye-Sarfo, Patrick and Mai, Qun and Sanfilippo, Frank M. and Preen, David B. and Stewart, Louise M. and Fatovich, Daniel M.}, year={2015}, month=oct, pages={62–73} }

In 2018 the two new algorithms higher order hidden Markov model and temporal convolutional network were proposed and emerged as challengers to the more traditional recurrent neural network and long-short term memory network as well as the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). In this study most major algorithms together with recent innovations for time series forecasting is trained and evaluated on two datasets from the theme park industry with the aim of predicting future number of visitors. To develop models, Python libraries Keras and Statsmodels were used. Results from this thesis show that the neural network models are slightly better than ARIMA and the hidden Markov model, and that the temporal convolutional network do not perform significantly better than the recurrent or long-short term memory networks although having the lowest prediction error on one of the datasets. Interestingly, the Markov model performed worse than all neural network models even when using no independent variables.}, author={Almqvist, Olof}, year={2019}, month=jun }

The model combines epidemiologic and demographic processes and is designed to mirror the impact of AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. Refinements on past work in this area include unequal probabilities for transmission from females to males and from males to females, the inclusion of an age- and sex-dependent sexual-partner choice function and distributed incubation plus infectious periods. Numerical studies suggest that unequal transmission probabilities (weighted to a greater probability from males to females than vice versa), and the tendency of males to choose sexual partners of the opposite sex younger than themselves, both act to increase the demographic impact of AIDS over that predicted with equal transmission between the sexes and partner choice restricted within given age classes. Analyses support the conclusions of past work that the epidemic will only have a small detrimental impact on the dependency ratio of a population (the ratio of dependents to working adults) even when a weighting is added to take account of the extra burden imposed by the care of adult AIDS patients. However, a small increase in the ratio can imply a significant rise in the number of dependents within the population. Stimulation studies of the impact of changes in behavior to reduce transmission highlight to the need to induce such changes as early as possible in the course of the epidemic in order to minimize its impact. Directions for future research are discussed emphasizing the need to acquire quantitative data on sexual habits and to construct models to represent heterogeneity in sexual behavior.}, journal={Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences}, author={Anderson, R M and Ng, T W and Boily, M C and May, R M}, year={1989}, month=jan, pages={240–274}, language={eng} }

Forecasting time series in these domains with traditional univariate forecasting procedures leaves great potentials for producing accurate forecasts untapped. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and in particular Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have proven recently that they are able to outperform state-of-the-art univariate time series forecasting methods in this context when trained across all available time series. However, if the time series database is heterogeneous, accuracy may degenerate, so that on the way towards fully automatic forecasting methods in this space, a notion of similarity between the time series needs to be built into the methods. To this end, we present a prediction model that can be used with different types of RNN models on subgroups of similar time series, which are identified by time series clustering techniques. We assess our proposed methodology using LSTM networks, a widely popular RNN variant. Our method achieves competitive results on benchmarking datasets under competition evaluation procedures.

Even though the benefit of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is well established, there is a regional variation in the extent of its benefit. The aim of this review is to highlight mortality and its predictors in Ethiopian adult HIV patients who were on ART. Methods. Relevant articles were searched on PubMed and Google Scholar databases. The search terms used in different combinations were predictor/determinant/factors, mortality/death/survival, HIV, ART/HAART, and Ethiopia. Result. 5–40.8% of the patients died during the follow-up period. More than half (50–68.8%) of the deaths occurred within 6 months of initiating ART. Advanced stage disease (stage III and stage IV), nonworking functional status (bedridden and ambulatory), low baseline CD4 count, low baseline hemoglobin level, TB coinfection, lower baseline weight, and poor treatment adherence were commonly identified as predictors of death in HIV patients.

The relative forecasting accuracy was assessed using the metrics from the M3, together with later extensions of scaled measures, and non-parametric statistical tests. The NN3 competition attracted 59 submissions from NN, CI and statistics, making it the largest CI competition on time series data. Its main findings include: (a) only one NN outperformed the damped trend using the sMAPE, but more contenders outperformed the AutomatANN of the M3; (b) ensembles of CI approaches performed very well, better than combinations of statistical methods; (c) a novel, complex statistical method outperformed all statistical and CI benchmarks; and (d) for the most difficult subset of short and seasonal series, a methodology employing echo state neural networks outperformed all others.

A comparison of performance using ANN forecast and other methods was reviewed. Hybrids of a neural network with other classical methods or meta-heuristics that improved performance of epidemic forecasts were analysed. Results: Implementing hybrid ANN using data transformation techniques based on improved algorithms, combining forecast models, and using technological platforms enhance the learning and generalization of ANN in forecasting epidemics. Conclusion: The selection of forecasting tool is critical to the precision of epidemic forecast; hence, a working guide for the choice of appropriate tools will help reduce inconsistency and imprecision in forecasting epidemic size in populations.

We present an extensive empirical study and an open-source software framework of existing RNN architectures for forecasting, that allow us to develop guidelines and best practices for their use. For example, we conclude that RNNs are capable of modelling seasonality directly if the series in the dataset possess homogeneous seasonal patterns, otherwise we recommend a deseasonalization step.

In the era of HIV and AIDS, families and households have continued to form, build, migrate and dissolve. Children born in the 1980s with the risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission have already gone on to start the next generation of families and households. Isolating the impact of HIV and AIDS on families and households is complex given that the epidemic has become part of the direction and force of contemporary demographic, social and economic processes and trends. Cycles of family and household life have occurred in a changing HIV and AIDS public-health environment, one in which HIV treatment access has increased rapidly.

The concept of prediction is delineated as it is understood by modellers, and illustrated by some classic and recent examples. A precondition for a model to provide valid predictions is that the assumptions underlying it correspond to the reality, but such correspondence is always limited—all models are simplifications of reality. A central tenet of the modelling enterprise is what we may call the ‘robustness thesis’: a model whose assumptions approximately correspond to reality will make predictions that are approximately valid. To examine which of the predictions made by a model are trustworthy, it is essential to examine the outcomes of different models. Thus, if a highly simplified model makes a prediction, and if the same or a very similar prediction is made by a more elaborate model that includes some mechanisms or details that the first model did not, then we gain some confidence that the prediction is robust. An important benefit derived from mathematical modelling activity is that it demands transparency and accuracy regarding our assumptions, thus enabling us to test our understanding of the disease epidemiology by comparing model results and observed patterns. Models can also assist in decision-making by making projections regarding important issues such as intervention-induced changes in the spread of disease.}, number={11}, journal={Clinical Microbiology and Infection}, author={Huppert, A. and Katriel, G.}, year={2013}, month=nov, pages={999–1005} }

The observed and predicted values of HIV epidemics are somewhat close and similar, as supported by the lower values of its RMSE, MAE, and MAPE and higher coefficient of determination. Further, findings showed that as per the United Nations’ SDG-3 of Project 2030, the Philippines is still far from the goals for ending the HIV epidemic due to an increase in HIV incidence in the country.

This epidemic has affected not only the children and adults but also infants born to HIV positive mothers. Unfortunately, there is no cure for HIV/AIDS; however, early and accurate prediction methods are required for early treatment and would be helpful to decrease the spread of the disease. Previous studies have investigated the early prediction of HIV infection, mainly utilizing HIV positive patients’ medical records. However, besides medical records, other characteristics, such as drug injection, sexual behavior, and other behavioral and biological factors, are also essential to consider while predicting the future acquisition of HIV. In this study, we developed and validated a prediction model for the probability of future HIV acquisition in high-risk groups. We developed prediction models using electronic medical records of patients from Nai Zindagi Trust (NZ), Pakistan. We analyzed the data for socio-demographic, behavioral (drug injection, sexual behavior), and biological features to predict the patients who are at high risk of acquiring HIV. State of the art data mining and machine learning techniques have been applied along with feature selection techniques for HIV risk prediction. The proposed model predicts HIV status with 82% accuracy having an improvement of 10–15% over dominant classifiers, i.e., SVM, Neural Network, J48, and PART. The new risk scores of HIV acquisition could assist health providers in counseling high-risk groups and in targeting intensified testing, treatment, and prevention to people at the greatest risk for HIV infection.}, author={Nisa, Sehar and Azhar, Mahmood and Ujager, Farhan and Malik, Mehwish}, year={2023}, month=mar }

We present a new method based on advanced machine learning algorithms for variable selection and prediction. The correlation based variable selection identifies a small set of informative variables that are used as inputs for an ensemble of neural networks and support vector regression algorithms to generate the predictions. We develop two types of models: univariate, that use only previous PV power data, and multivariate, that also use previous weather data, and evaluate their performance on Australian PV data for two years. The results show that the univariate models performed similarly to the multivariate models, achieving mean relative error of 4.15–9.34%. Hence, the PV power output for very short-term forecasting horizons of 5–60min can be predicted accurately by using only previous PV power data, without weather information. The most accurate model was univariate ensemble of neural networks, predicting the PV power output separately for each step of the forecasting horizon.}, journal={Energy Conversion and Management}, author={Rana, Mashud and Koprinska, Irena and Agelidis, Vassilios G.}, year={2016}, month=aug, pages={380–390} }

@article{Wang_Aviles_2023, title={Contrasting Univariate and Multivariate Time Series Forecasting Methods for Sales: A Comparative Analysis}, volume={7}, DOI={10.22158/asir.v7n2p127}, abstractNote={In commodity-based industries, accurate sales forecast is very important for effective inventory management and decision-making. Univariate and multivariate time series forecasting methods have been widely used to predict commodity sales. The purpose of this study is to make a comprehensive comparative analysis of these two methods under the background of commodity sales forecast. Firstly, the concept of time series prediction and its significance in the field of commodity sales are introduced. It emphasizes the challenges related to sales forecast, including demand fluctuation, seasonality and external factors affecting sales model. The forecasting methods of univariate time series, such as ARIMA, are discussed in detail, focusing on their ability to capture the time correlation in a single sales variable. In contrast, the multivariate time series prediction method considers the relationship between multiple variables. Vector autoregressive and multivariate extension of ARIMA. These techniques combine the interaction of various factors, including external influences, to improve the accuracy of prediction. In order to make a comprehensive comparative analysis, a data set including historical sales data of specific commodities is used. Both univariate and multivariate models are suitable for forecasting future sales, and their performance indicators are evaluated by MASE. The results show that although univariate models are easier to implement and explain, they often fail to capture the complex interdependence between different factors that affect sales. On the other hand, the multivariate model shows excellent prediction accuracy by integrating related variables and their dynamic relationships. However, they need more additional data and more complex modeling techniques. Finally, the research gives the practical significance and suggestions of choosing an appropriate forecasting method based on the characteristics of commodity sales data and the specific business environment. It emphasizes the importance of considering the accuracy and interpretability of the prediction model in practical application.}, journal={Applied Science and Innovative Research}, author={Wang, Feng and Aviles, Joey}, year={2023}, month=may, pages={p127} }

The initial dataset consisted of 151 countries with five dependent variables and 90 explanatory variables (reduced to 50 after extensive exploratory data analysis of missing value patterns, undesirable multi-colinearities and multivariate outliers).Five measures were analyzed, namely HIV/AIDS Cases per 100,000 population; number and percentage of adults age 15–49 living with HIV/AIDS virus; estimated number of AIDS-related deaths for adults and children; and percentage of male sexual transmitted disease patients diagnosed with HIV/AIDS (identified by canonical correlation as not amenable to significant predictions).Reasonably good fit regression models () were developed with all coefficients significant (p < 10%) that could explain each of the four specific AIDS measures and assess the validity of nine literature-based hypothesis.The major conclusion of this research is that countries with lower population density that manage to provide better health system performance, per capita support (doctors, nurses and hospital beds) with better media information (radio, phone and TV access), and not necessarily higher GNP are more likely to exhibit lower HIV/AIDS indicators. Interestingly, the “spoilers” of the widely anticipated negative relationship between HIV/AIDS prevalence and wealth of countries are the healthier of the wealthiest and the wealthier of the sickest.The results lead to the development of a data envelopment analysis (DEA) output-oriented assurance-region model for 116 countries, with few missing data values imputed, using as inputs and outputs pertinent ratios, which identified 17 efficient nations. A list of DEA efficiencies portrays each country’s potential relatively to its peers to fight the pandemic by minimizing HIV/AIDS rates if additional resources were available.These findings should be useful to health policy makers and researchers of multi-country studies on determinants of the AIDS pandemic and global efficient strategies for combating it.}, journal={European Journal of Operational Research}, author={Zanakis, Stelios and Ortiz Ahlf de Alvarez, Cecilia and Li, Vivian}, year={2007}, month=feb, pages={1811–1838} }
@article{Zeng_Chen_Zhang_Xu_2022, title={Are Transformers Effective for Time Series Forecasting?}, url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13504}, abstractNote={Recently, there has been a surge of Transformer-based solutions for the long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) task. Despite the growing performance over the past few years, we question the validity of this line of research in this work. Specifically, Transformers is arguably the most successful solution to extract the semantic correlations among the elements in a long sequence. However, in time series modeling, we are to extract the temporal relations in an ordered set of continuous points. While employing positional encoding and using tokens to embed sub-series in Transformers facilitate preserving some ordering information, the nature of the emph{permutation-invariant} self-attention mechanism inevitably results in temporal information loss. To validate our claim, we introduce a set of embarrassingly simple one-layer linear models named LTSF-Linear for comparison. Experimental results on nine real-life datasets show that LTSF-Linear surprisingly outperforms existing sophisticated Transformer-based LTSF models in all cases, and often by a large margin. Moreover, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies to explore the impacts of various design elements of LTSF models on their temporal relation extraction capability. We hope this surprising finding opens up new research directions for the LTSF task. We also advocate revisiting the validity of Transformer-based solutions for other time series analysis tasks (e.g., anomaly detection) in the future.
